# My Data Visualizations
Here you'll find a collection of data visualizations I've made for class, work, and personal practice. 

Note: All visualizations were made for the purpose of data exploration.

### Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) Loans: Kabbage, Inc. Online Lender

The online lender Kabbage, Inc. is featured in the [ProPublica PPP fake farms story](https://www.propublica.org/article/ppp-farms). To show where Kabbage was lending money, I made a county-level map that shows the percentage of loans in each county that were Kabbage loans.

You can find the R code for analysis in the kabbage-counties-data folder and my visualization here:

### Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) Loans: Barber Shops
###### :computer: R, Tidyverse, Datawrapper

In [Derek Willis'](https://merrill.umd.edu/directory/derek-willis)data journalism class, we used R to analyze [PPP loan data](https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/covid-19-relief-options/paycheck-protection-program/ppp-data) from a variety of states, counties, and industries. In this case, we were visualizing which states had the largest amount of loan applications to barber shops. 

You can find the R code for analysis in the [barber-shop-data folder](https://github.com/jennacohen/data-viz/tree/main/barber-shop-data) and my visualizations here:

### DC & Marvel Comic Characters: LGBTQ+ Representation
###### :computer: R, Tidyverse, Datawrapper

Comic books are consumed widely across all identities, but I wanted to explore how characters in these comics reflect their audience. I expected to see little representation of LGBTQ+ characters across both universes. My finding, however, was that there is essentially no representation of LGBTQ+ characters- with over 99% of characters in each universe holding a straight identity. I used the [538 Comic Datasets](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/comic-characters) for my analysis.

You can find the R code for analysis in the [comics-analysis](https://github.com/jennacohen/data-viz/tree/main/comics-analysis) and my visualizations here:

### Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) Loans: ggplot Analysis
###### :computer: R, Tidyverse, Tidycensus, ggplot

In [Derek Willis'](https://merrill.umd.edu/directory/derek-willis) data journalism class, we used R and ggplot to create a variety of visuals to better understand our PPP loan data. 

You can find the data in the [gg-plot](https://github.com/jennacohen/data-viz/tree/main/gg-plot) folder and my markdown file containing the ggplot code here:
