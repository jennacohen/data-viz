#### Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) Loans: Barber Shops
###### R, tidyverse, datawrapper

In Derek Willis' data journalism class, we used R to analyze PPP loan data from a variety of states, counties, and industries. In this case, we were visualizing which states had the largest amount of loan applications to barber shops. 

You can find the R code for analysis in the barber-shop-data folder and the visualizations here:

Percentages of Undisbused Loans 

#### Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) Loans: Kabbage, Inc. Online Lender
###### R, tidyverse, datawrapper

The online lender Kabbage, Inc. is featured in the [ProPublica PPP fake farms story](https://www.propublica.org/article/ppp-farms). To show where Kabbage was lending money, I made a county-level map that shows the percentage of loans in each county that were Kabbage loans.
